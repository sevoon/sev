i have depression, iwec. If you want to bmf then please, PLEASE tell me whats wrong. If you want space then tell me, if i did something wrong tell me. Communication is KEY. I plead you, dont suddenly leave just because im mentally unstable or i cross the line between you and me. I wanted more friends, so i do go too far, THEN AT LEAST TELL ME, please. i beg you, dont leave me. Im traumatized, i dont want to be left alone, but it doesnt mean i need attention 24/7..

to my ex friend, faking your death makes my whole "person" of mine ruined, yes i mean everything. Im not blaming you for leaving , for leaving me for your sake. But why didnt you talk to me? You just suddenly left, it makes me worried. But you choose a probably worst way possible, im sorry if i did something wrong, im sorry for caring about you too much. But seriously, i dont want you to do this way, even i accidentally drived you to the edge to the point you faked your death, i know im a total idiot, a stupid person that can be compared to a jellyfish and shrimp ( jellyfish has no brains, and shrimps has shit near their brain, it means my brain only has shit in it. ). I apologized in dms, i wanted yo cut ties with you, but you remain silent. Maybe you really, really despise me? Im sorry, i dont beg you to still be my friend, i only wanted you to hear me for the last time. That im deeply sorry.
